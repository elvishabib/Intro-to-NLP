# Intro-to-NLP
The goal of this project is to find the subject of each text from the data. This is called Topic Modeling. It’s the essence of many application such as Search Engine or Spam filters for example.

Project Gutenberg is the effort of Michael S. Hart to digitize and archive cultural works, as well as to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks, which he invented in 1971.
The project reached 62 108 books, most are in the public domain. We’ll use 52 for this project.

For each book, we generate its bag of words and its associated word cloud.

Now we must find the subject of each text using the data.

Finally we create a function best_recommended_books that suggest to the buyer of a book the 5 most related books
to buy.
